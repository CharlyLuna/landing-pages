# LANDING PAGES
This repo contain landing pages of real web sites, these are just to practice basic html, css, js skills, none of the pages are part of their official projects, they are just made for learning purposes.

**These projects are based on the videos made by MiduDev** (great influencer :D) but with some improvements to practice more and learn. 

*I don't pretend to get credit of it, most of the code was made following the steps of midu and some changes were made according to my personal way of coding.*
